        <h4>How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>We need to design for the smallest devices first which will give a better overall user experience.</li>
            <li>Mobile devices are not going away.</li> 
          </ul>
        <h4>How to improve UX by Understanding Users</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>"It is really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them." -Steve Jobs</li>
            <li>Be There</li>
            <li>Be Useful</li>
            <li>Be Quick</li>
            <li>Reachability - Think about how people handle their device and where convenience.</li>
            <li>Speed matters</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>We need to care and be empathetic to our users needs.</li>
            <li>Move the main navigation bar to the bottom of the page so people can easily reach.</li>
            <li>Good reachability makes people think the apps run faster even though they may not.</li>
            <li>Menu with a border is more effective than using a hamburger button.</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Make it simple.</li>
            <li>When using forms only include the information that is necessary.</li>
            <li>Give plenty of space for fingers to click.</li>
            <li>When you can't simplify the form break it into sections.</li>
            <li>Enable autocomplete on your forms</li>
            <li>With passwords, give the user the option to show the password.</li>
            <li>Tap a phone number to call</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Designing a better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>RESEARCH when advertising!</li>
            <li>DON'T USE POP UPS</li>
            <li>Make ads small and simple.</li>
            <li>Users don't come to your website to look at ads.</li>
          </ul>
